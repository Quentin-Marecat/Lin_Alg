# LINEAR ALGEBRA PACKAGES IN FORTRAN

The aim of these packages is not to be efficient, but to be applied in a **pedagogical way**

Here is the list of all packages of the depository :
* Cholesky decomposition
* QR decomposition Householder + GS
* LU decomposition
* Hessenberg decomposition
* Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization
* Tridiagonalisation matrix Householder + Givens
* Matrix inversion
* RQ process diagonalization + shift method
* Jacobi diagonalization
* Iterative Power diagonalization
* A.**x** = **b** solution with residual improvement

Next step :
* SVD factorization
* Lanczos + Davidson diagonalization
* Eigenvectors using iterative method

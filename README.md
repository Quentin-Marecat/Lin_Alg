# LINEAR ALGEBRA PASCKAGES IN FORTRAN

The aim of these packages is not to be efficient, but to be applied in a **pedagogical way**

Here is the list of all packaging of the depository :
* Cholesky decomposition
* QR decomposition
* LU decomposition
* Gram-Schmidt orthonormalization
* Matrice inversion
* RQ process diagonalization

Next step :
* SVD factorization
* Lanczos diagonalization
* A.**x** = **b** solution
